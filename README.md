# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 (must be greater than 12.10.x)
- Install [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Creating a test iModel
To successfully run this tool you will need to have an accessible iModel. If you don't have one already [this](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/tutorials/create-test-imodel-sample/)  guide will help you to create it.
If you want to create iModel in your local environment then follow  [this](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/tutorials/create-test-imodel-offline/) tutorial.

## Client application registration
Client application registration procedure can be found [here](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/tutorials/registering-applications/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone <github link>
```
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm run start <query.json>           # Run with iModel from hub
```
To use iModel from your local machine
```
npm run start:snapshot <file path> <query.json>     # Run with local iModel
```

## Query file structure

Query file structure below.

| Name | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **name**           | name for your queries set                                                        |
| **description**    | description for your queries        				     	                        |
| **url**            | link to your iModel project  							                        |
| **folder**         | name of the folder where queries results will be saved                           |
| **queries**        | array for your queries						                                    |
| **store**          | file name in which query results will be stored                                  |
| **query**          | ECsql query to be executed        						                        |

### Example query

An example query file with four simple queries.
> **Note! <b>Don't forget to change url to accessible iModel if you want to run this example<b>**

```
{    
    "name": "example",
    "description": "simple example queries on how tool works",
    "url" : "https://connect-imodelweb.bentley.com/imodeljs/?projectId=<put your project id here>&iModelId=<put your model id here>&ChangeSetId=<put your changeset id here>",
    "folder" : "./example",
    "queries": {
        "schema": {
            "store" : "schema",
            "query" : "select distinct sc.Name, sc.VersionMajor vMaj, sc.VersionMinor vMin, sc.DisplayLabel, sc.Description from meta.ecclassdef cl join meta.ecschemadef sc on cl.schema.id = sc.ecinstanceid where cl.ecinstanceid in (select distinct(ecclassid) from bis.element)"
        },
        "classes" : {
            "store" : "class",
            "query" : "select * from meta.ecclassdef cl join meta.ecschemadef sc on cl.schema.id = sc.ecinstanceid"                        
        },
        "3dElements" : {
            "store" : "3dElements",
            "query" : "SELECT element.ECClassId, element.ECInstanceId ElementId, element.UserLabel, element.CodeValue FROM bis.GeometricElement3d element"
        },
	      "2dElements" : {
            "store" : "2dElements",
            "query" : "SELECT element.ECClassId, element.ECInstanceId ElementId, element.UserLabel, element.CodeValue FROM bis.GeometricElement2d element"
        }
    }
}
```
Running example queries file should create a new folder with a structure like this:

```
/out/example
    |-->schema.csv
    |-->classes.csv
    |-->3dElements.csv
    |-->2dElements.csv
```

## Testing

To run tests use command

```
npm run test
```

It will create TestiModel.bim file and run test queries from TestQueries.json.

Existing tests check if:
    * CSV files are correctly generated from imodel.
